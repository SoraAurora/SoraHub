A Collection of Custom Written Game Scripts by yours truly.

This is just my little own personal project , I simply create custom scripts used for exploiting games on roblox then slapped it into a hub then slapped on a key system. and BOOOOOM walah ogey BAIIII have Fun :D!

# How to Use?
# Step 1
Download/Copy SoraHub_Load.lua
# Step 2
Paste or Open SoraHub_Load.lua in your exploit. Supported Exploits are Krnl and Synapse
# Step 3
Inject & Execute , follow the instructions on the popup and u can get the public key
# Step 4
Have Fun!

# Note
SoraHub_Main.lua/SoraHub_Load.lua works only with Krnl or Synapse. Due to Command Prompt KeySystem code being supported by the two mentioned. Please Use Source Code directly if your exploit is neither.
